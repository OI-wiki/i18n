## String matching problem

### Single string match

There is a pattern string, and a string to be matched. We need to find all occurrences of the former string in the latter string.

### Multi-string matching

There are multiple pattern strings, and one string to be matched (multiple strings to be matched can be directly concatenated).

It is certainly possible to treat it as multiple single string matching problems, but the efficiency is not good enough.

### Other types of string matching problems

For example, match any suffix of one string, and match any suffix of multiple strings, etc.

## Brute force solution

For each position, try to compare the pattern string with the string to be matched.

Template Code:

(pseudocode)

```cpp
std::vector<int> match(char *a, char *b, int n, int m) {
  std::vector<int> ans;
  for (i = 0; i < n - m + 1; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < m; j++) {
      if (a[i + j] != b[j]) break;
    }
    if (j == m) ans.push_back(i);
  }
  return ans;
}
```

Time complexity analysis:

The worst time complexity is $O(nm)$ , and the best is $O(n)$ .

If the size of the character set is greater than 1 (there exists at least two different characters), the average time complexity is $O(n)$ . But in OI problems, the strings given are generally not purely random.
