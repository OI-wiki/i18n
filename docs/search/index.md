Search, a technique that enumerates the state space, finds the optimal solution or counts the number of legal solutions by exhausting all the possibilities.

There are many ways to optimize search, such as reducing the state space, changing the search order, pruning, etc.

Search is the basis of some advanced algorithms. In OI, pure searching is often a method to get partial points, but there are very few problems that you can get full marks for through pure search.
