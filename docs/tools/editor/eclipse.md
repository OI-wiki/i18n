This article will briefly introduce Eclipse.

## Introduction

Eclipse is a famous cross-platform open-source integrated development environment. Eclipse is initially used to develop in Java, and currently it is also used to develop in other programming language like C++, Python and PHP with plug-in. 

Eclipse itself is a framework platform. However, supports from various plug-ins provides Eclipse good scalability. Therefore, many software developers choose Eclipse as the framework to develop their own IDE.

Eclipse is originally the next generation IDE developed by IBM as an alternative of commercial software Visual Age for Java. In November 2001, it was donated to open-source community, and is now being managed by Eclipse, a non-profit organization.

Advantages: 
- Better experience;
- Easy to get started.

Drawbacks: 
- Eclipse is slower in opening than Visual Studio;
- Unpredictable updating frequency, which means updating of plug-ins may not be not able to follow up Eclipse's. 

## Installation and Configuration Guide

For major linux distributions, Eclipse is already in their package repositories. This instruction is based on Microsoft Windows. 

### Perquisites

You will need Java Runtime and MinGW.

#### Download & Install Java Runtime

## Advanced Readings

The manual of Eclipse is detailed, therefore we recommend newly users to read the manual or Google when encountering problems. And Eclipse's feel of use is similar to Visual Studio.

Similar to [Visual Studio Code](./vscode.md), Eclipse provides many plug-ins, which may help Eclipse be even easy to use.
