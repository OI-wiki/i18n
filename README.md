## Content

Programming competitions have been around for many years. Its difficulty level is increasingly higher, and the content is getting increasingly more complicated. However, most of the online materials are scattered, which takes a lot of time to explore, and beginners often do not know how to learn relevant knowledge systematically.

In order to make it easier for friends who love programming competitions to get started, in July 2018, **OI Wiki** was migrated to GitHub. As the content of **OI Wiki** continues to improve, more and more friends are starting to join in.

**OI Wiki** is aimed to be a free, open and continuously updated knowledge integration website. You can find interesting and practical knowledge about **competitive programming** here. We have prepared the content including basic knowledge, common types of questions, problem-solving ideas, and common tools, etc., to help everyone learn programming competitions more quickly and deeply.

Right now, the content of **OI Wiki** still has many imperfections, the coverage of knowledge points is not comprehensive enough, and there are some pages whose quality needs to be modified. The **OI Wiki** team and the contributing friends are actively improving these content.

For the content to be improved, please refer to [Issues](https://github.com/OI-wiki/OI-wiki/issues) and [Iteration Plan](https://github.com/OI-wiki/OI-wiki/labels/Iteration%20Plan%20%2F%20%E8%BF%AD%E4%BB%A3%E8%AE%A1%E5%88%92) of **OI Wiki**.

At the same time, **OI Wiki** originates from the community, advocating the **intellectual freedom**, and will never be commercialized in the future. We will always maintain its independent and freedom.

## Deploy

This project is currently deployed at [oi-wiki.org](https://oi-wiki.org) using [MkDocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs).

We also maintain a list of mirror sites at [status.oi-wiki.org](https://status.oi-wiki.org). The contents and [oi-wiki.org](https://oi-wiki.org) are the same.

Of course, it can also be deployed locally. (**Requires Python 3**)

**If you encounter any problems, you can refer to [F.A.Q.](https://oi-wiki.org/intro/faq/) for more information.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OI-wiki/OI-wiki.git --depth=1

cd OI-wiki

# Install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs

# Use our customized theme
chmod +x ./scripts/install_theme.sh && ./scripts/install_theme.sh

# Two ways(choose one is enough):
# 1. Run a local server, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 to view the effect
mkdocs serve -v

# 2. Get a static page under the site folder
mkdocs build -v

# To obtain the description of the mkdocs command line tool (explains the meaning of commands and parameters), please use
mkdocs --help
```

We are now rendering MathJax on the server side. If you want to achieve a similar effect, you may refer to [.travis.yml](https://github.com/OI-wiki/OI-wiki/blob/master/.travis.yml) for more details. ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) required)

### Mirror

```bash
# The content of the mirror repository on Gitee is the same as the GitHub repository
git clone https://gitee.com/OI-wiki/OI-wiki.git
```

### Offline version

You can use the content of the `gh-pages` branch

```bash
git clone https://gitee.com/OI-wiki/OI-wiki.git -b gh-pages
```

It may be more convenient to start an http server locally.

```bash
# If python3
python3 -m http.server
# If python2
python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
# In some environments, you can’t find an executable file named python3/python2, so try running python to see if it works
```

### Docker

See [Docker deployment](https://oi-wiki.org/intro/docker-deploy/) for details.
